## Introduction

We are going to be using a document generating framework (Quarto, built off of RMarkdown) to explore how to use git and give us a background into using Quarto to generate a document.  

Lots of help can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
